1. Your Key Strengths (Extracted From Resume + Experience + Cover Letter)

These are the themes your website should highlight because they differentiate you:

Data Science & ML Engineering

ARIMA–XGBoost forecasting pipeline (+65% improvement) –

Rolling window adaptive modeling –

Deep learning model optimization for X-Decoder / COCO –

Time series forecasting (NVIDIA stock volume from tweets) –

Power system demand modeling (SARIMAX/BPN) –

Data Engineering & Cloud

Azure Synapse + Medallion Architecture + RapidAPI + Power BI –

PDF data extraction with Camelot (equity in federal funding) –

Full-Stack Development

React + SQL backend + Google Maps API (Citale social platform) –

Hackathon Wins & Research

DS+X Hackathon Winner (RhettSearch gamified research engine) –

Civic Tech Hackathon Winner (U.S. Virtual Garden, Groq API) –

BIT Lab research volunteer under Prof. Dokyun Lee –

Course Strengths

Deep Learning (A)

Databases (A-)

Tools for Data Science (A)

ML Topics (A) –

These tell a very strong story:
“A data science engineer who builds real systems, not just notebooks.”

✅ 2. Recommended Modern Portfolio Website Structure

This structure is based on best practices for data scientists + recruiter viewing patterns.

🌟 (Hero Section) — Immediate Impression
Title:

“Hsiang Yu (Anna) Huang — Data Scientist & ML Engineer”

Subheadline:

A short, punchy description:
“I build machine learning systems, cloud pipelines, and full-stack tools that turn data into real impact.”

Hero Visual (recommended):

Abstract ML/data visualization background

Or a screenshot of your best project (RhettSearch / Virtual Garden)

CTA Buttons:

📌 1. About Me

This section should tell a narrative, NOT copy your resume.

What to include:

Your identity as a data scientist (resume summary → )

Your BU program (transcript → )

Your cross-discipline background (finance + industrial management + CS → )

A short story about what motivates you

Modern layout style:

Two columns

Left: Photo or modern avatar

Right: Text + quick "core skills" badges (Python, Azure, PyTorch, React…)

📌 2. Featured Projects (Your strongest section)

Your projects are impressive — they should be the centerpiece.

Use large cards with:

Thumbnail image

Tech stack badges

“Problem → Approach → Impact” small summary

GitHub & Demo links

Recommended Featured Projects (top 4):
⭐ 1. RhettSearch – Hackathon Winner

Gamification + semantic search + AI recommendations

Uses OpenAI + OpenAlex

Strong full-stack + ML + UX story
→

⭐ 2. U.S. Virtual Garden – Hackathon Winner

Interactive dashboard, Groq API, LLM-generated descriptions

Strong engineering + data viz
→

⭐ 3. NVIDIA Tweet Sentiment → Volume Forecast (Azure Pipeline)

Real-time data ingestion

Medallion architecture

Forecasting
→

⭐ 4. Optimizing X-Decoder for Low-Power Computer Vision (Deep Learning)

Model compression / efficient inference

COCO and RefCOCOg benchmark improvements
→

Optional smaller projects to list below:

ARIMA–XGBoost graphic card forecasting

Power system demand modeling

Equity in federal earmarking analysis

📌 3. Experience

Show impact-focused cards rather than resume blocks.

Example layout:
Company	Role	Dates	Pill-style task bullets
Citale (BU Spark! Launch Lab)	Full Stack Developer	2025	4–5 bullets
NTUST AI Lab	Research Assistant	2023–24	Achieved 73.4% R² gain
NTUST Stats Lab	Research Assistant	2023	Shelf optimization models

Add visual icons (React badge, Python badge, SQL badge…)

Cite content from resume →

📌 4. Skills

Modern websites use skill categories + logos.

Suggested layout:
Languages & Libraries

Python, R, C++, JavaScript, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn
→ (from resume)

Cloud & Data Engineering

Azure, Supabase, SQL, ETL, Medallion Architecture
→ (from resume)

Visualization

Power BI, Looker Studio, Python visualization libs
→ (from resume)

Design Tools

Photoshop, InDesign
→ (from resume)

📌 5. Research

Create a clean timeline:

Generative Engine Optimization Research (BU BIT Lab)

Deep Learning Course Project

Sales Forecasting in Manufacturing (ARIMA–XGBoost)

Power System Frequency Regulation Modeling

These give academic credibility.

📌 6. Education

Simple, clean card style.

Boston University (3.57 GPA)

MS Data Science

Courses with high grades (Deep Learning, Tools for DS, Databases)
→ from transcript

NTUST

Dual BBA (Industrial Management + Finance), CS minor
→ from resume

📌 7. Contact

Make it simple:

Email

LinkedIn

GitHub

Resume (PDF)

Include a “Message me” form if you want recruiters to reach you directly.

🎨 3. Visual Design Style (Modern, DS/AI Friendly)
Recommended aesthetic:

Minimalist Tech Theme

White / black base

Accent color: Azure blue (#0278D0) or BU red (#CC0000)

Geometric shapes or data-inspired patterns

Smooth hover animations

Light/dark mode toggle

Use Next.js + Tailwind (fast, modern, easy to deploy)

Section transitions:

Subtle parallax

Gradient dividers

Animated SVG or Lottie (for ML icons)

🚀 4. What Recruiters Will Love Most About Your Profile

Your site should highlight these 6 points clearly:

You build end-to-end ML systems (not just models).

You have strong cloud engineering and pipeline skills (Azure).

You have full-stack development experience (rare for DS candidates).

You have multiple hackathon wins — this signals creativity + execution.

You are involved in research (shows depth & rigor).

Your projects show measurable improvements (R² from 8.3% → 73.4%).

This is VERY strong for full-time DS, ML, or analytics roles.
