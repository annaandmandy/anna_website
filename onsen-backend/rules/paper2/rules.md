# Hot Spring Usage Guidelines

**Location:** Hot Spring Area  
**Displayed:** After entering the hot spring

1. **Do not remain in the hot spring for longer than 15 minutes.**  
   Prolonged exposure may cause you to perceive entities not intended for human observation.

2. **If you exceed the recommended time, proceed calmly to the cold spring area.**  
   Cooling is a standard method for restoring perceptual balance.

3. **Do not discuss your experience with other visitors.**  
   Differences between individuals are not relevant.
